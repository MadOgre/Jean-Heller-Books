    <p class="about-jean tagline">My mother once confronted my husband and me, put her hands on her hips, and asked, “Can’t one of you hold onto a job?”</p>
    <p class="about-jean">She was joking – sort of. Both of us were journalists, and we kept getting better jobs, which required moving. A lot. Moving frequently is, I have discovered, a good way to avoid having to clean out the closets, the garage, and the cabinets under the kitchen sink.</p>
    <p class="about-jean">Through it all, I have been one thing above all else, a writer.</p>
    <p class="about-jean">I started my first novel when I was in the third grade, the story of people living at the center of the earth. I liked the concept, but I really didn’t have a good plot point, and when I discovered what it’s really like at the center of the earth, the project sort of went up in flames, so to speak.</p>

    <p class="about-jean">My first complete novel, a thriller called “Maximum Impact,” was published by Forge, an imprint of St. Martin’s Press, in 1993. My second, “Handyman,” came two years later. Both received great reviews from critics, and both will be available in Kindle editions in early 2015.</p>

    <p class="about-jean">The new one, also a thriller, is called “The Someday File.” It is the first in what will be a series set in Chicago, a city I have loved since I was in college and which I have called home for years. I set it here because Chicago is such a great character in its own right. The stories I can build on these bones&mdash;quite literally in the case of “The Someday File”&mdash;have infinite possibilities.</p>

    <p class="about-jean tagline">Enjoy!</p>
